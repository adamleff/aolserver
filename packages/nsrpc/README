Installation:
    The default value for INSTALLPATH is /user/local/aolserver/lib. You can
    override that on the command line if needed.

    % make INSTALLPATH=/usr/local/aolserver/lib install

Loading:
    Load the package using ns_itcl and then run the nsInit proc.

    server1:nscp 1> ns_ictl package require nsrpc
    1.0
    server1:nscp 2> ::nsrpc::nsInit
    1

Alternative Loading:
    If you have the HEAD version of AOLserver you can use the nsd config
    to load packages and run the init commands. This feature is unreleased
    and subject to change:

    ns_section "ns/server/server1/packages"
        ns_param librarylist [list /user/local/aolserver/lib]
        ns_param packagelist [list nsrpc]

Configuration:
    Default values can be overridden with the following nsd config prams:

    ns_section ns/servers/${serverName}/packages/nsrpc
        ns_param maxthreads 10           ; # The max number of rpc threads.
        ns_param minthreads 1            ; # The min number of rpc threads.
        ns_param threadtimeout 60        ; # Time idle before timeout.
        ns_param maxconns 0              ; # Number of conns before die (0=off).
        ns_param operationtimeoutms 1000 ; # Total operation timeout in ms.

Usage:
    You can send commands to server running this package. First export the 
    command you want to execute (this is done on the remote server):

    server1:nscp 3> ::nsrpc::export ns_time
    1

    Make the call to execute the exported procedure:

    server1:nscp 4> ::nsrpc::call 10.10.0.116:8000 [list ns_time]
    1178142293

    See the in-line documentation on how to send files and set the per-call
    timeout flag.

Non-blocking Usage:
    
    server1:nscp 5> ::nsrpc::queue 10.10.0.116:8000 [list ns_time]
    job0
    server1:nscp 6> ::nsrpc::wait job0
    1178828140

Non-blocking Detached Usage:

    server1:nscp 7> ::nsrpc::queue -detached 10.10.0.116:8000 [list ns_time]
    job1

    server1:nscp 8> ::nsrpc::wait job1
    no such job: job1

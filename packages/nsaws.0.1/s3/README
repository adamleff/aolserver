This distribution includes packages for communicating with the Amazon Web
Services.  The aws package is the core package. The aws API is used to create a
request object, set params, queue the request, wait for the request, and
destroy the request object. The other packages provide convenient
service-specific wrappers for the aws API (COMING SOON).

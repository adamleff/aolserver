Installation:
    The default value for INSTALLPATH is /user/local/aolserver/lib. You can
    override that on the command line if needed.

    % make INSTALLPATH=/usr/local/aolserver/lib install

Loading:
    Load the package using ns_itcl and then run the nsInit proc.
   
    server1:nscp 1> ns_ictl package require nsrpc
    1.0
    server1:nscp 2> ::nsrpc::nsInit 
    1

Usage:
    You can send commands to server running this package. First export the 
    command you want RPC to execute (this is done on the remote server):

    server1:nscp 3> ::nsrpc::export ns_time
    1

    Make the call to execute the exported procedure:

    server1:nscp 4> ::nsrpc::call 10.10.0.116:8000 [list ns_time]
    1178142293

    See the in-line documentation on how to send files and set the per-call
    timeout flag.
